## Some useful Chinese latex templates.

I've found many beautiful latex templates to write essay in many websites, but they can't support Chinese. Therefore I modified the .cls document to make it available to Chinese. Hope you will love my templates.

You need to use 'UTF8' code and compile the tex file by XeLaTeX, by TexStudio.

If you have any question about my templates, never hesitate to contact me.
